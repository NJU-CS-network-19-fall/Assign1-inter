# Assignment 1: Datalink layer: Topology
## Due Sep 25, 2019, 11:59PM (GMT+8)

**You can just open Readme.ipynb, it's same.**

### Intro
Mininet enables you to quickly create, interact with, customize and share a software defined network(SDNs) prototype, and provides a smooth path to running on hardware with a single command:
`$ sudo mn`
Then you should see this,
````
*** Starting CLI:
mininet>
````
Use `mininet> quit()` to exit mininet. \
More common usage of Mininet is through:
`$ sudo mn --MANY_ADDITION_ARGUMENT`  \
And you can even write a python script to run Mininet \
`$ sudo python YOUR_SCRIPT.py` including `from mininet.SOMETHING import SOMETHING_YOU_NEED` in `.py` file

## The following part and Assignment is basically follows the [tutorial](http://mininet.org/walkthrough/)

Next we will show you some Mininet basic function, you can open the `.ipynb` file with Anaconda Jupyter Notebook or just type the command in Ubuntu Terminal.

i.e. the code in Notebook `!echo $pd | sudo -S mn --custom topo.py --topo mytopo --test pingall` works equally with command `sudo mn --custom topo.py --topo mytopo --test pingall` in Terminal.

But I still highly recommend you using Notebook benefiting from its real-time feedback.

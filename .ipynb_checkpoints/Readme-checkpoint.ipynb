    "## Due Sep 25, 2019, 11:59PM (GMT+8)\n",
    "### Intro\n",
    "Mininet enables you to quickly create, interact with, customize and share a software defined network(SDNs) prototype, and provides a smooth path to running on hardware with a single command:\n",
    "`$ sudo mn`\n",
    "Then you should see this,\n",
    "````\n",
    "*** Starting CLI:\n",
    "mininet>\n",
    "````\n",
    "Use `mininet> quit()` to exit mininet. \\\n",
    "More common usage of Mininet is through:\n",
    "`$ sudo mn --MANY_ADDITION_ARGUMENT`  \\\n",
    "And you can even write a python script to run Mininet \\\n",
    "`$ sudo python YOUR_SCRIPT.py` including `from mininet.SOMETHING import SOMETHING_YOU_NEED` in `.py` file\n",
    "\n",
    "## The following part and Assignment is basically followed the [tutorial](http://mininet.org/walkthrough/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we will show you some Mininet basic function, you can open the `.ipynb` file with Anaconda Jupyter Notebook or just type the command in Ubuntu Terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "i.e. the code in Notebook `!echo $pd | sudo -S mn --custom topo.py --topo mytopo --test pingall` works equally with command `sudo mn --custom topo.py --topo mytopo --test pingall` in Terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "But I still highly recommend you using Notebook benefiting from its real-time feedback."

    "#### 1.1 Basic Usage\n",
    "You can use command like `$ sudo mn` to display Mininet client like `mininet>`\\\n",
    "Get help `$ sudo mn -h` \\\n",
    "Some common command:\n",
    "````\n",
    "# Display nodes:\n",

    "# Display links:\n",
    "mininet> net\n",
    "# Dump information about all nodes:\n",
    "mininet> dump\n",
    "````\n",
    "In `mininet>`, some Ubuntu Terminal toolkit still can be used like \\\n",
    "`ifconfig` `ping` and `python` or `py`. \\\n",
    "Use `mininet> h1 ping -c NUM_PING_TIMES h2` to measure RTT time and data transport rate. \\\n",
    "Use `mininet> pingall` to check connectivity and `mininet> iperf` to measure start2end bandwidth. \\\n",
    "Use `exit()` or `quit()` to exit python or Mininet.\n",

    "#### 1.2 API Usage\n",
    "You can also write your python script with [Mininet's API](http://mininet.org/api/hierarchy.html) and Mininet also has many built-in python script like:\n",
    "````\n",
    "# build a http server\n",
    "mininet> h1 python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80 &\n",
    "mininet> h2 wget -O - h1\n",
    "mininet> h1 kill %python\n",
    "````\n",
    "And you can also write your own python script via `import mininet.*` \\\n",
    "Then run them with `$ sudo python YOUR.py`. \n",
    "\n",
    "However for your convenience, we provide a script where you just need to fill the topology part to get the assignment done(It's your choice whether to use it or write a new one for better performance). \n",
    "\n",
    "Back to Mininet, you can also run python code line in Mininet client(CLI):\\\n",
    "`mininet> py 'hello ' + 'world'` and something likewise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover you will find Mininet providing many optional arguments like `--controller` `--link` `--switch`. You can get familiar with it via [Coding viewing](https://github.com/mininet/mininet/tree/master/examples), checking API documents or searching online.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3 Mininet GUI(optional)\n",
    "It's kinda like a [toy](http://www.brianlinkletter.com/how-to-use-miniedit-mininets-graphical-user-interface/) `$ sudo folder_contain_mininet/mininet/examples/miniedit.py`"
